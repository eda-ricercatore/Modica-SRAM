; 
; A node (net) in a circuit can have alias node names because:
; 1. there are hierarchical alias names from instances of subcircuits;
; 2. the very small resistors are shorted;
; 3. there are DC voltage sources of 0 Volt connected to the node;
; 4. the node is replaced by the back-annotated RC network;
; 5. the RC network is reduced.
;
; The following node names specified in the spice netlists, spf files,
; or config commands are not primary names. Their primary names are
; printed for cross reference in the following syntax:
;
;     <primary node_name>  <the alias node name>
;
; The first field of each line is the primary node name picked by the
; netlist parser and the second field is the original node name used
; in the spice netlists, spf files or config commands.
